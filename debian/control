Description: Photogrammetry in geographical context
 This package include photogrammetry command line tools from IGN (www.ign.fr).
 They were primarly designed do create a complete pipeline for long range
 photogrammetry (DEM, DTM, orthophotos...) but they are powerful and versatile 
 enought to apdapts in archaeological or even cultural heritage contexts.
 .
 In contrast to other pipelines (Bundler + PMVS), that came from Computer 
 Vision background, the pipeline of IGN come from Photogrammetry background. As a 
 result, it should be more exigent and less easy-to-use, but it offer widers 
 possibilities and much more features (georeferencing, ortophotos, depth maps, 
 distortion models for fish-eyes...). MicMac is particullary confortable 
 working on quasi planar scene (fa√ßade, stratigraphic cross sections...).
 .
 This tools are licenced under the CeCILL-B, a french adaptation of the BSD
 software : Apero, to compute orientation
