Description: Photogrammetry in geographic context
 This package include photogrammetry command line tools from IGN (www.ign.fr).
 They were primarily designed to create a complete pipeline for long range
 photogrammetry area (DEM, DTM, orthophotos...) but they are powerful and versatile 
 enough to adapts themselves to archaeological and cultural heritage contexts.
 .
 In contrast to other pipelines (Bundler + PMVS), that come from Computer 
 Vision background, the pipeline of IGN come from Photogrammetry background. As a 
 result, it should be more exigent and less easy-to-use, but it offer wider 
 possibilities and much more features (georeferencing, ortophotos, depth maps, 
 distortion models for fish-eyes...). MicMac is particullary confortable 
 working on quasi planar scene (fa√ßade, stratigraphic cross sections...).
 .
 Some of the tools included:
 Pastis extracts and matches tie points. Apero computes orientations and
 MicMac generate the dense matching.
 .
 MicMac suite is still under heavy devlopement and is licensed under CeCILL-B, 
 a French adaptation of the BSD
