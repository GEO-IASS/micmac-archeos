Next releases
=============

- Use a relative path in Elise error reports

- Are headers in include/XML*/ useful ? If not, XML* 
should maybe be installed in /var/...

- Make a watch script

- Look at change in path organization upstream and 
finally clean hardcoded stuffs (maybe patch a config.h.in)

- Auto DicoCamera installation? on first launch mm3D 
should create $HOME/.micmac/*.xml.
postinst scripts and /usr/skel  should be avoided

- Re-implement an open source 'Sift' w/ vlfeat:
 * Tiling for big images and good memory management
 * Native support of 1b Tiff (instead of pgm) to integrate 
   seamlessly w/ Pastis

- Re-implement an open source Flann based matcher
